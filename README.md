#DiverseOut
#### DiverseOut Client

** App in progress, coming very soon!  **

DiverseOut makes it easier for tech companies to gather and release their diversity data. Tech giants have finally [started to release](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/12/30/2014-the-year-silicon-valley-spilled-its-diversity-data/) their diversity numbers, but what about smaller startups that make up much of the industry? DiverseOut aggregates and displays diversity data for tech companies of all sizes. Company representatives can create private surveys for their employees, with varying levels of data abstraction to ensure employee privacy.
